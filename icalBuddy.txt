NAME
       icalBuddy -- query the OS X calendar database for items

SYNOPSIS
       icalBuddy [options] command

DESCRIPTION
       icalBuddy queries the OS X calendar database for items and outputs
       them.

       The options are as follows:

       command	   Specifies the general action to take. Possible values are:

		   "eventsToday"	   Print events occurring today

		   "eventsToday+NUM"	   Print events occurring between
					   today and NUM days into the future,
					   where NUM is an integer

		   "eventsNow"		   Print events occurring at present
					   time

		   "eventsFrom:START to:END"
					   Print events occurring between the
					   two specified dates. The dates
					   (START and END) may be specified in
					   a natural language form (such as
					   "tomorrow at noon" or "june 10 at 6
					   pm") or as relative dates (such as
					   "today+3" or "yesterday-2") but the
					   safest format is "YYYY-MM-DD
					   HH:MM:SS +HHMM" (the "+HHMM" part
					   at the end specifies the timezone
					   offset in hours and minutes from
					   GMT, and it may have a plus or
					   minus prefix)

		   "uncompletedTasks"	   Print uncompleted tasks

		   "undatedUncompletedTasks"
					   Print uncompleted tasks that have
					   no due date

		   "tasksDueBefore:DATE"   Print uncompleted tasks that are
					   due before the given date. DATE may
					   be specified in a natural language
					   form (such as "tomorrow at noon" or
					   "june 10 at 6 pm") or as a relative
					   date (such as "today+3" or
					   "yesterday-2") but the safest
					   format is "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
					   +HHMM" (the "+HHMM" part at the end
					   specifies the timezone offset in
					   hours and minutes from GMT, and it
					   may have a plus or minus prefix)

		   "calendars"		   Print a list of all the calendars

		   "strEncodings"	   Print all the possible string
					   encodings

		   "editConfig" 	   Open the configuration file for
					   editing in a GUI editor application

		   "editConfigCLI"	   Open the configuration file for
					   editing in a command-line editor

       -V, --version
		   Print version number and exit.

       -u, --checkForUpdates
		   Check for updates to self. Also allows for automatic
		   updating of self (with minimal user interaction, straight
		   from the command line.)

       -d, --debug Print diagnostic information into the standard error stream
		   (for example, how input dates are interpreted).

       -sc, --separateByCalendar
		   Separate events/tasks in the output by calendar.

       -sd, --separateByDate
		   Separate events/tasks in the output by date.

		   -sed, --showEmptyDates
			   Display sections for empty dates (i.e. dates that
			   have no items) that fall within the specified range
			   as well. Applies only if the -sd argument is used.

		   -t, --showTodaysSection
			   Always display the section for the current date
			   (even when it is empty). Applies only if the -sd
			   argument is used.

       -sp, --separateByPriority
		   Separate tasks in the output by priority.

       -f, --formatOutput
		   Use ANSI escape sequences to format the output and
		   hopefully make it more readable.

       -nc, --noCalendarNames
		   Omit calendar names from the output. Does not apply if the
		   -sc argument is used.

       -nrd, --noRelativeDates
		   Never use "natural language relative dates" (e.g. "today",
		   "yesterday" or "day after tomorrow") instead of the default
		   date format presentation (see the -df argument).

       -npn, --noPropNames
		   Omit property names from the output (i.e. only show
		   property values -- e.g. "My house" instead of "location: My
		   house").

       -n, --includeOnlyEventsFromNowOn
		   If the command value "eventsToday" is used, only output
		   events that occur between the current time and the end of
		   the day (as opposed to events that occur between the start
		   and end of the day, as by default.)

       -na, --maxNumAttendees
		   Maximum number of attendees to show for events.

       -nnc, --maxNumNoteChars
		   Maximum number of characters to display from notes.

       -uid, --showUIDs
		   Display event/task UIDs (unique identifiers).

       -eed, --excludeEndDates
		   Do not output the dates/times of when events end.

       -ea, --excludeAllDayEvents
		   Do not output all-day events.

       -li, --limitItems num
		   Limit the number of printed items (events/tasks) in the
		   output to a maximum of num items.

       -std, --sortTasksByDate
		   Sort tasks by their due dates, in descending order.

       -stda, --sortTasksByDateAscending
		   Sort tasks by their due dates, in ascending order.

       --strEncoding encoding
		   Use the specified string encoding for the output. Run the
		   app once with the 'strEncodings' command value to see all
		   the possible values you can use here.

       -tf, --timeFormat format
		   Format times included in the output based on the format
		   formatting string. See the Date and Time Format Specifiers
		   section below for documentation on the syntax to use.

       -df, --dateFormat format
		   Format dates included in the output based on the format
		   formatting string. See the Date and Time Format Specifiers
		   section below for documentation on the syntax to use.

       -po, --propertyOrder value
		   Print properties of events/tasks in the order specified by
		   value, which must be a comma-separated list of property
		   names. The allowed property names are: title, location,
		   notes, attendees, url, datetime, priority.

       -ps, --propertySeparators value
		   Use the strings specified in value as the separators
		   between item properties in the output. value must be a list
		   of strings where each component is separated by an
		   arbitrary character that is present also as the first and
		   the last character in the value (that means you can use any
		   character you'd like as the separator, as long as you also
		   use it at the beginning and the end.) The components
		   specified in value will be used in order, for each item,
		   starting from the first printed property. If the number of
		   printed properties for an item is bigger than the number of
		   components in value, the last component is used as the
		   separator for the remaining properties. For example, a
		   value of "|, | - |" would specify ", " as the separator
		   between the first and the second property and " - " as the
		   separator between all the rest of the properties. The
		   default is "|\\n    |" (i.e. use a newline and four spaces
		   as the separator for all properties.)

       -b, --bullet value
		   Sets value as the string to be used as the bullet point in
		   the output.

       -ab, --alertBullet value
		   Sets value as the string to be used as the alert bullet
		   point in the output.

       -ss, --sectionSeparator value
		   Sets value as the string to be used as the section
		   separator in the output. The default is a newline followed
		   by a bunch of hyphens (-).

       -ic, --includeCals value
		   Includes only items from specific calendars into the
		   output. value must be a comma-separated list of calendar
		   titles or UIDs (you can see UIDs (unique identifiers) for
		   your calendars by using the 'calendars' command parameter.)
		   The -ic and -ec parameters will be handled in the order of
		   first include, then exclude.

       -ec, --excludeCals value
		   Excludes items from specific calendars from the output.
		   value must be a comma-separated list of calendar titles or
		   UIDs (you can see UIDs (unique identifiers) for your
		   calendars by using the 'calendars' command parameter.) The
		   -ic and -ec parameters will be handled in the order of
		   first include, then exclude.

       -ict, --includeCalTypes value
		   Includes only items from specific types of calendars into
		   the output. value must be a comma-separated list consisting
		   of one or more of the following: birthday, caldav,
		   exchange, imap, local, subscription, icloud ("icloud" is an
		   alias for "caldav", and vice versa, because iCloud
		   calendars on Lion are actually CalDAV calendars). The -ict
		   and -ect parameters will be handled in the order of first
		   include, then exclude, and are always applied before the
		   -ic and -ec parameters.

       -ect, --excludeCalTypes value
		   Excludes items from specific types of calendars from the
		   output. See -ict for a list of allowed values. The -ict and
		   -ect parameters will be handled in the order of first
		   include, then exclude, and are always applied before the
		   -ic and -ec parameters.

       -iep, --includeEventProps value
		   Includes only event properties specified by value into the
		   output. value must be a comma-separated list of property
		   names. Possible property names are: location, url, notes,
		   attendees, datetime, title.

       -eep, --excludeEventProps value
		   Excludes event properties specified by value from the
		   output. value must be a comma-separated list of property
		   names. See -iep for a list of possible property names. A
		   value of "*" will exclude all properties and make sure just
		   the title is printed.

       -itp, --includeTaskProps value
		   Includes only task properties specified by value into the
		   output. value must be a comma-separated list of property
		   names. Possible property names are: url, notes, datetime
		   and priority.

       -etp, --excludeTaskProps value
		   Excludes task properties specified by value from the
		   output. value must be a comma-separated list of property
		   names. See -itp for a list of possible property names. A
		   value of "*" will exclude all properties and make sure just
		   the title is printed.

       -cf, --configFile path
		   Use the configuration file located at path instead of the
		   default one (~/.icalBuddyConfig.plist). Pass in an empty
		   string ("") to make icalBuddy ignore the configuration file
		   completely.

       -lf, --localizationFile path
		   Use the localization file located at path instead of the
		   default one (~/.icalBuddyLocalization.plist).

       -nnr, --notesNewlineReplacement value
		   Replaces newlines in values of the notes property with
		   value.
